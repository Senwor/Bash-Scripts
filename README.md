# Bash-Scripts
A series of bash scripts that time-save for various activities (HackTheBox, CTF's, Pentesting, messing around, etc.)  Most scripts are scrapped together from other scripts that I have found useful w/ added personal touch. 

## tun0
Simple script that displays your set interface.  Default interface is tun0.

## johnRocks
Runs john against the given hash with rockyou.txt.  Can take additional flages.  Usage: johnRocks <file> <flags>
